# TODO

1. Make vertex buffer update able. Just create large buffer for now, maybe later make it so that you can create larger buffer if current one is filled up, later tho, later.
2. Make some sort of abstraction, we should be able to call `drawRect(x, y, width, height)` or something for some time and it should draw those rects.
3. Add Triangles.
4. Add Textures.
5. Add Texts.

Ofc, we build up batch system while we complete above.
